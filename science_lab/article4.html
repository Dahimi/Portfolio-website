								<h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
								<p>Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the relationship between heat, work and the conversion of energy between different forms. The key concept is that heat is a form of energy corresponding to a definite amount of mechanical work. As you go through this article, we will be able to understand thermodynamic quantities and how laws of thermodynamic operate in our daily lives. </p>

								<h3>Thermodynamics states:</h3>
								<p>To apply thermodynamics laws, we should define a system that will be the object of our study. For example, the system could be a gas inside a cylinder with a movable piston, the planet Earth, a black hole, or even the entire universe. In general, systems might exchange heat, work, and other forms of energy with their surroundings called external system. A system’s condition at any given time is called its thermodynamics state. For our gas the state of the system is identified by the temperature, pressure, and volume of the gas called state functions. These properties depend only on the initial and final states of the system, not on the path followed by the system from one state to another</p>
								<h3>Thermodynamics equilibrium:</h3>
								<p>We can now define thermodynamics equilibrium of our system in which there is no tendency for its state to change spontaneously. For example, the gas in a cylinder with a movable piston will be at equilibrium if the temperature and pressure inside are uniform and if the piston doesn’t produce any work. The system can then be made to change to a new state only by an externally imposed change in one of the state functions, such as the temperature by adding heat or the pressure and the volume by moving the piston.</p>
								<h3>Work and internal energy:</h3>
								<p>Energy has a precise meaning in physics that does not always correspond to everyday language. It is defined as the ability to do work, which is the ability to exert a force causing displacement of an object, so it simply means the force that causes things to move. For example, a man pushing on a car may feel that he is doing a lot of work, but no work is done unless the car moves. The work done is then the product of the force applied by the man multiplied by the distance through which the car moves.<br>
								In thermodynamics, the system's internal energy is called the total energy that a system contains. The system's energy can change by transferring heat or work (or both) between the system and its surroundings. If positive work is applied, the system gains energy. It is defined as the energy associated with the disordered motion of molecules. It is separated in scale from the macroscopic ordered energy associated with moving objects; it refers to the invisible microscopic energy on the atomic and molecular scale.

								<h2 class="section-title">Basic definitions</h2>
								<p>In our daily life, we usually see some thermodynamics application using electrical devices, it’s called Thermoelectricity or Peltier-Seebeck effect wish is the direct conversion of heat into electricity or electricity into heat through two related mechanisms, the Seebeck effect and the Peltier effect. One of the most used applications of thermoelectricity are:</p>
								<h3>	Temperature measurement</h3>
								<p>To measure temperatures, we use a device called thermocouple made of two wires of dissimilar metals joined together at one end, called the measurement hot junction. The other end, where the wires are not joined, is connected to the signal conditioning circuitry traces, typically made of copper. This junction between the thermocouple metals and the copper traces is called the reference cold junction. The voltage produced at the reference junction due to the difference of temperature depends on the ones at both: the measurement junction and the reference junction. the reference junction temperature must be known to get an accurate absolute temperature reading. This process is known as reference junction compensation (cold junction compensation).</p>
								<h3>Instant ice formation</h3>
								<p>We can instantly make ice using the Peltier effect which is the opposite of the Seeback effect. It creates a temperature difference by transferring heat between two electrical junctions if a voltage is applied across joined conductors to create an electric current. When the current flows through the junctions of the two conductors, heat is removed at one junction and cooling occurs. Heat is deposited at the other junction.</p>
								<h3>Food storage</h3>
								 <p>We usually use refrigerators to store our food and drink, but have you ever wondered how it works. The circulation of the refrigerant (which is the system of this study defined earlier) inside them and its transformation from a liquid into a gas is the secret. This process, called evaporation, cools the surrounding area, and produces the desired effect. You can test this process for yourself by taking some alcohol and putting a drop or two on your skin. As it evaporates, you should feel a chilling sensation - the same basic principle gives us safe food storage. </p>
								 <p>To start the evaporation process and change the refrigerant from liquid to gas, the pressure on the refrigerant needs to be reduced through an outlet called the capillary tube. </p>
								 <p>To keep a refrigerator running, you need to be able to get the gaseous refrigerant back to its liquid state, so the gas needs to be compressed to a higher pressure and temperature again. This is where the compressor comes in. Once the compressor has done its work, the gas should be under high pressure and hot. It needs to be cooled in the condenser, which is mounted on the back of the refrigerator, so its contents can be cooled by the ambient air. When the gas cools off inside the condenser (still under high pressure), it changes back into a liquid. Then, the liquid refrigerant circulates back to the evaporator where the process starts all over again and then your food is safely stored.</p>
