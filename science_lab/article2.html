								<h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
								<p>
									Computers have been around for decades, and over the past years new technologies have emerged, replacing their predecessors. Every year, we get a new CPU generation, smaller transistors, faster RAMs and so on and so forth.
								</p>
								<p>
									Most of those inventions are rather enhancement more than radical breakthroughs – Believe it or not, modern computers are still built upon the same layers as their precursors; But there is one technology that seems to be the next big thing, yeah you guessed it: Quantum Computers. Quantum Computing sounds cool and promising, since they rely on quantum mechanics principles that govern the world of atomic and sub-atomic particles.
								</p>
								<p>
									Many people claim it is going to be the next market killing machine with its promising computing power.

								<h2 class="section-title">Why do we need quantum computers in the first place?!</h2>
								<p>Computing power is growing at a very fast rate. Almost every 2years, our computers get twice faster and smaller. What used to be a room-sized computer is now equivalent to a laptop in terms of computational power. This is what call Moore’s Law.</p>
								<p>That said, it might seem reasonable to think that a conventional computer could solve any computational task. It is just a matter of time – after all, we should just wait Moore’s law to do its magic. Well, it is not that easy! </p>
								<p>Why? Because we presume that Moore’s Law will always be valid forever, whereas this is far from the truth. To ensure that Moore’s Law persists, transistors – which are the backbones of modern computers – have to get smaller and smaller. And in our essay to build thinner electronics we will inevitably hit an insurmountable problem; It is the hardware limits.</p>
								<p>You see, classic computers rely under the hood on electronics, which in turn is based on classical physics law. The problem arises when our electronic components get to the size of an atom. In this case, quantum effects take over and our classical physic laws fall short.</p>
								<p>If conventional computers could compute a variety of tasks, there is also a wide range of problems where they fall short. Those tasks take our best supercomputers long period of time to compute. And even if we suppose the validity of Moore’s Law, we cannot solve them in the foreseeable future.</p>
								<p>‘Our computers are not very good at mastering the following tasks:’</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Optimization</li>
									<li>computational Chemistry</li>
									<li>Financial Modeling</li>
									<li>Cryptography</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									This is where quantum computers can shine. While classical computers are built upon digital logic, quantum computers are based on quantum principles. Having that said, by taking advantage of quantum effects, quantum computers could process information in parallel. This will spectacularly speed up computations. Though quantum computing is still in its infancy, we can envision how it will be superior to conventional computing.
								</p>
								<h2 class="section-title">How does a quantum computer work? </h2>
								<p>
									As said earlier, traditional computers use bits to process information. A bit represents the smallest unit of information, which can be either 0 or 1.  Quantum computers on the other hand use Qubits. And just like their classic counterpart, qubits are the fundamental set of information a quantum computer could hold. Nevertheless, compared to bits, qubits can be in the state of 0 and 1 at the same time before being measured. Though it sounds counter-intuitive, this feature- that allows qubits to be in multiple states simultaneously - is well tested and experimentally proven.  It is even one of the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics: <strong>Superposition</strong>.
								</p>
								<h3>Superposition</h3>
								<p>
									Let’s attempt to break down Quantum Superposition to fully grasp what it stands for:
								</p>
								<p>
									The law of superposition states that, at a quantum scale and prior to measurement, a physical system may be in a combination of all the possible configurations. In other words, before measurement, a quantum system exists as a blurry blending of different states.
								</p>
								<p>To comprehend how this is bound up with Qubits, you could imagine them as quantum bits that until you check their value, they hold the probability of being 0 or 1.</p>
								<p>As you can see, quantum superposition gives more freedom to qubits, but in order to employ them efficiently, we need to bind them together. And this is where quantum entanglement comes to play. </p>
								<h3>Entanglement</h3>
								<p>
									If superposition is power, quantum entanglement is superpower. Two quantum systems are entangled when they are coupled in a such way that the measurement of one of the system’s state indicates the state of the other even when the two systems are separated by light years distances. This action of instantaneous effect is what Einstein called “Spooky action at a distance.”. No matter how weird this idea of quantum entanglement may sound, there are many notable experimental results proving it. (You could check this Wikipedia article for more details)
								</p>
								<p>
									So due to entanglement, the states of entangled qubits can give you accurate information about each other even if there are light years apart.
								</p>
								<h2 class="section-title">How close are we?</h2>
								<p>
									Though scientist shed light on quantum computers’ computational advantage decades ago, quantum computing is still at its infancy.  In this regard, many decade-long quantum programs are increasingly being launched by countries to take advantage of the groundbreaking advances in the field of quantum computing.
								</p>
								<p>
									But it has become a fiercely contested race between big tech companies and an all-out competition is unfolding.  GOOGLE, for one, has announced that their quantum computer was able to perform a computation task thousands of times faster than the world’s most powerful computer - Thereby claiming quantum supremacy. IBM has also disclosed its 50 Qubit quantum computer, which is indeed an astonishing feat of science and technology.
								</p>
								<p>Nonetheless, it’s just the beginning and there are many roadblocks awaiting the breakthroughs we are aspiring to. And building a fully functional quantum computer will certainly take time and money.</p>
